### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Majored in Media Studies, and specialised in Design Thinking, I am currently learning how to program to try to create interactive art and playfull websites.

In a 6 month pause from my communication and customer experience carreer, I hope to gain enough knowledge to build amazing plataforms for fun and amusement.
